# The-Library-Of-Babel

The Library of Babel is based on a book by Jorge Luise Borges.
"The Library of Babel" is a short story by Argentine author and librarian Jorge Luis Borges,
conceiving of a universe in the form of a vast library containing all possible 410-page books of a certain format and character set

The Library Of Babel Algorithm was originaly created my Jonathan Basile.
Jonathan Basile made this algorithm in C#

C# Version can be found [here](https://www.libraryofbabel.info)

Then I made a JS version of of the algorithm of The Library of Babel but sadly I couldn't make the image archives of The Library of Babel
